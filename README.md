# Overview
This repository is created from a project I did last semester in my Artificial Intelligence class. It solves the game of boggle by choosing al the possible words that can be created after the die roll.

# Purpose
This project not only solves the game of boggle for you in minimal time but it also priorizes high value words so if it is unable to find all words in the alloted time, you can be sure you got the best words no matter what.

# How To Contribute
To contribute find an issue of a bug or feature you want to address, if none exist create one. Create a seperate branch off of master named after the issue and when ready submit a pull request and it will be reviewed for inclusion into the master branch. Once it has been reviewed and all changes are made, it will be merged into master.
